# CPL - Characters per Line

This is a simple extension that counts the amount of characters that are selected when you click and drag to select text. This is great for being able to count the amount of characters in a line if you are into that type of control over the typography in your web page. 


## Usage
Use your mouse to select text and get a read-out of the number of characters you have selected. This is helpful if you need to know how many characters are in a line of text. You can also select as much text as you want and it will still tell you how many characters you have selected.

### Example usage

This is intended to be used for development purposes during the "design-to-code" phase.
